# Car Purchase Optimization for Seed Stage Founder

## Profile
- Seed stage AI/healthcare founder in SF elite hacker house
- $175k income but not paid yet (cash flow conscious)
- Can access capital but needs ROI justification
- 210 miles/week commute (30 miles/day)
- Free home charging available
- Need founder credibility for fundraising/networking

## Budget & Constraints
- **Maximum budget: $50k** (if clearly justified)
- **Optimal range: $20-35k** (sweet spot for value + image)
- **Minimum: $15k** (below this looks too budget-conscious)

## TCO Components (3-year ownership)
1. **Purchase price** (biggest factor)
2. **Depreciation loss** (resale value in 3 years)
3. **Fuel costs** ($550/year EV vs $1,100-2,400/year gas)
4. **Maintenance** ($300-1,000/year depending on brand)
5. **Insurance premium** (+$0-600/year for luxury)
6. **Registration/taxes** (~$500/year CA)

## Car Categories by TCO

### Practical Hybrids ($12-14k TCO)
- Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, Camry Hybrid

### Luxury Steals ($15-18k TCO)
- 2018-2021 BMW 330i/330e, Audi A4, Genesis G70
- **Sweet spot** - luxury credibility at reasonable cost

- 25% depreciation, higher maintenance but strong image

### Smart EVs ($16-20k TCO)
- Low-mile Tesla Model 3, BMW i4, Genesis GV60

## Search Criteria
- **Target years: 2018-2024**

## Key Insights
- Depreciation is 60-70% of TCO

- Founder image tax of $3-5k over 3 years is justifiable
